description: The Ewer Code of Conduct sets standards for communication and behavior in the community.
---

## Purpose

A primary goal of The Ewer is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in The Ewer to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are unacceptable within our community:

* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Inappropriate photography or recording.
* Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
* Discussion, encouragement, or enablement of egregious violations of the FINAL FANTASY XIV Terms of Service, as defined in this Code of Conduct

## Relationship with the FINAL FANTASY XIV Terms of Service

We understand that many of the projects in The Ewer community may constitute a violation of the FINAL FANTASY XIV Terms of Service. With that said, the following will be considered to be egregious violations of the Terms of Service:

* Commercial, for-profit use of any Square Enix intellectual property
* Real-money trading (RMT), or creation of systems to enable it
* Cheating, especially in the context of creating tools to assist in solving fight mechanics using information that would not ordinarily be available to a player
* Any activity that can be reasonably expected to disrupt the experience of other players of the game, such as botting or spamming

As allowing discussion, encouragement, or enablement of these egregious violations can compromise the safety and stability of the community as a whole, these acts are _strictly_ prohibited within The Ewer.

Outside of egregious violations of the Terms of Service, we strongly encourage all community members to be mindful of the content they create, and the impact it may have on the FINAL FANTASY XIV development and modding community as a whole.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify the moderation team as soon as possible.

Additionally, moderators are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement (if applicable), or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

## Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the moderation team with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.

## Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, sponsors, and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
